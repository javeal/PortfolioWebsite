			<h1>Projects and Courses</h1>
			<p>
				Below are lists of projects I am either currently working on, or am planning to work on this year. Followed by that is a list of my coursework
				related to my areas of interest. These courses were all excellently taught and highly enjoyable. Each of these courses had a large influence on
				my career decisions and project selections. Finally, I have a section on past projects, dating all the way back to the beginning of college. I
				do not have any projects I have done professionally on this page. Each section and project can be expanded for more details by clicking on the
				corresponding title.
			</p>

			<h2>Current Projects</h2>
			<div class="current_projects">
				<h3>Phone Time Management Android App</h3>
				<div class="phone_app">
					<p>
							This is a project I have been looking forward to, because I have never made an app before! The goal of this project is to develop an App
							that tracks the amount of time I spend on my phone each day. I plan to use this app to help me keep my phone usage and poor time management
							under control. This project will require me to do quite a bit of research, and will be one of the more difficult projects I have attempted
							since graduating college. Even though many apps like this already exist, I would like to make this app available for anyone to use. I am
							planning to start this project in march. Here are some deliverables I have created for myself on this project.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<h5>Requirements:</h5>
						<li>The app will track time used per day month and year</li>
						<li>The app will be have a configurable notification system for time spent on the phone</li>
						<li>The code must be easily editable to add information on the dangers of phone usage</li>
						<li>The App must be easily destributed and installed</li>
						<li>The app will track phone time in different catagories such as texting time, game time, and socail media time (stretch goal)</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>Facial Recognition Website Login</h3>
				<div class="recognition_webiste">
					<p>
							This project is intended to be an interface for a facial recognition project I worked on in college. This was my first ever machine learning
							project! This was also my final project in my digital signal processing class described in the coursework section. It is also mentioned in the past
							projects section. My goal is to clean up the code I wrote 2 years ago and improve the speed. The facial recognition algorithm makes use of PCA to
							reduce the size of the data and remove noise. The object then follows the PCA demensionality reduction with a tweaked version of k-nearest
							nieghbors (KNN). In this version the reference distance is the average face and the number of nearest neighbors is 1. I know much more about
							PCA and KNN now which should allow me to improve the project significantly! I would like to build a web based interface using the Django framework
							that will allow users to interact with the algorithm. I want the users to be able to save data to the webserver and login to view their data using their
							face. This is an ambitious project that will require frontend work that could be challenging for me! Some deliverables for this project are given below
					</p>
					<ul>
						<h5>Requirements:</h5>
						<li>The website will support uploading of images to train the algorithm based on new users</li>
						<li>The webiste will have a backup login system in case facial recognition fails</li>
						<li>The website will have all data collection set to optional</li>
						<li>The website will login users in a timely manner</li>
						<li>The website will access the webcam to allow user to take pictures and upload them </li>
						<li>The website must have a threshold of error that minimizes incorrect classifications</li>
						<li>The website will have a way to report incorrect classifications</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						This class was taken in the spring of 2018 and taught by Dr. Alexsandar Dodganzich. This was an introductory course to digital signal Processing
						that covered basic signal fundamentals for the first half and DSP techniques for the second half. In the first half of the course we focues on
						the Fourier Series, DTFT, Z transform, and the DFT. In the second half of the course we covered things like windowing, the FFT algorithm, filter
						design, sampling and reconstruction and image processing. This course included a lab that was done in MATLAB. Lectures were theoretical with
						problem sets given as assignments.
					</p>
				</div>

				<h3>Communication Systems</h3>
				<div class="ee321">
					<p>
						This class was taken in the fall of 2018 and taught by Dr. Sang Kim. This course covered the theory of communication systems. This class did
						not have a lab but included MATLAB portions of the homework. This class covered topics such as FM, AM, and other modulation schemes. Some other
						topics were line coding, signal properties, signal transmissions, sampling and reconstruction.
					</p>

			<h2>Past Projects</h2>
			<div class="past_projects">
				<h3>Facial Recognition System</h3>
				<div class="facial_recognition">
					<h5>Description:</h5>
					<p>
						This facial recognition system was implimented using the PCA algorithim. The PCA algorithim is a machine learning technique that makes use
						of EigenFaces, Euclidean Distance and data compression. This system was developed in Python using the Spyder IDE from Anaconda. The system is
						only currently functional in the Spyder IDE. The next step is to use python to run the system in Windows PowerShell. This will allow the system
						to run with a GUI and access the webcam of a computer.

				<h3>This Website</h3>
				<div class="website">
					<h5>Description:</h5>
					<p>
						This Website was developed to describe projects that I have worked on that cannot be included in my resume. This website was developed using
						the Atom text editor for its Github inegration features. The source code for this website can be found on my Github page, and of course by
						pressing ctrl+u. The two main languages used to develop this website were HTML and CSS. By working on this project I grew my skills in web
						development and Git. I will update this website as I continue to work on new projects and develop new skills. This website was created to allow
						viewers of my Linkedin profile and Resume to learn more about my experience and work history.

				<h3>Responsive Vehicle</h3>
				<div class="responsive_vehicle">
					<h5>Description:</h5>
					<p>
						The objective was to navigate through an obstacle course, without being able to look at the obstacle course. The project was done using a Rumba
						Vaccum fitted with a Texas Instruments Micro-Controller and a variety of sensors. This project was coded in C and made use of GUI to navagate the
						robot. The robot collected data from the sensors and sent the data to the GUI through an SSH connection. The robot was configured to connect to
						wifi to make the SSH connection possible. Commands were sent to the robot through the connection once data had been recieved by the GUI. Some of
						the obstacles included cliffs, tall poles, short poles and an out of bounds line.

				<h3>DTMF Encoder/Decoder</h3>
				<div class="dtmf">
					<h5>Description:</h5>
					<p>
						DTMF is the logic of encoding frequencies for dial up calls. The various dial tones are a combination of of two frequencies, and those frequencies
						depend on the location of the number on the dial pad. This project required the design of very narrow band pass filter that could decode the
						frequencies the system recieved. The signals were incoded by the generation of sinusoids based on the number entered. The system produced the tones
						and delivered the decoded results. This was done using MATLAB.

				<h3>Random Number Generator</h3>
				<div class="random_number">
					<h5>Description:</h5>
					<p>
						The Random Number Generator is a project developed using Altera products in the area of digital circuit design. The numbers were generated using
						 a formula that produced a output that varied depending on the input. The design process included creating state machines, truth tables, and circuit
						 diagrams in altera. For convience, some of the components were coded using Verilog. Some components inside the Generator were Register Files,
						 Registers and a parallel shift Register. The input was controlled with switches on an Altera board, and the output was shown on 7 segment displays.

				<h3>Sound System Receiver</h3>
				<div class="analog_receiver">
					<h5>Description:</h5>
					<p>
						This project can be consisted of the design of 3 analog filters. There was a second order active low pass filter, a second order active high pass
						 filter, and a first order active band pass filter. The idea of the filters was to divide parts of the signal to send to different types of speakers.
						 For example, low frequencies would be directed to a subwoofer. Some of the components used to create this system were op amps, capacitors, inductors
						 and resistors.
